#BigDataFinal
This repository contains tripolar EEG data recorded from 2 subjects (of 5 total) in a visual evoked potential (VEP) response experiment.
tEEG data for each subject exists in a .set/.fdt file pair. 
An ipython notebook, developed in Jupyter notebook, used for VEP is provided. Said notebook requires the installation of the MNE module.
See below link for installation instructions:

A poster, made in PowerPoint, is also provided to outline the present VEP research in tEEG recordings.
To select a subject for localization, set the teeg_id variable to the subject id of "ct" or "ps"
Suggested localization scales are provided in comments for each subject in the last 2 cells of the ipython notebook.

Required head model and electrode coregistration files are included as well.
